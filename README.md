# Programming-Scripting-Project-18
This repository contains a project wich focuses on the Fisher's Iris data set. The project requires researching the data set, and then writing documentation and code in the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language based on that research. 

### Research Background

At first sight, Petal length and petal width seem to diverge from the normal distribution - graphs

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset from the 1930s; it is one of the first modern examples of statistical classification.
The setting is that of Iris flowers, of which there are multiple species that can be identified by their morphology. Today, the species would be defined by their genomic signatures, but in the 1930s, DNA had not even been identified as the carrier of genetic information.

The following four attributes of each plant were measured:
Sepal length
Sepal width
Petal length
Petal width
