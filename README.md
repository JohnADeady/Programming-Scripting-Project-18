# Programming-Scripting-Project-18
This repository contains a project which focuses on the Fisher's Iris data set. The project requires researching the data set, and then writing documentation and code in the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language based on that research. 

### Introduction
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper *The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems* as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. Two of the three species were collected in the Gasp√© Peninsula all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus.(ref [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set))

The iris dataset contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species.The three classes in the Iris dataset:
 * Iris-setosa 
 * Iris-versicolor 
 * Iris-virginica 

The four features of the Iris dataset:
 * sepal length in cm
 * sepal width in cm
 * petal length in cm
 * petal width in cm

Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.(ref [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set))

### Importance of Fisher's Iris Data Set
Fisher's linear discriminant analysis used methods in statistics and pattern recognition to find a linear combination of features which characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events. The resulting combination may be used as a linear classifier ([ref](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1ab8/ea71fbef3b55b69e142897fadf43b3269463.pdf))

This lead to the development of machine learning.

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset from the 1930s; it is one of the first modern examples of statistical classification.
The setting is that of Iris flowers, of which there are multiple species that can be identified by their morphology. Today, the species would be defined by their genomic signatures, but in the 1930s, DNA had not even been identified as the carrier of genetic information.

The following four attributes of each plant were measured:
Sepal length
Sepal width
Petal length
Petal width
