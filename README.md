# Programming-Scripting-Project-18
This repository contains a project which focuses on the Fisher's Iris data set. The project requires researching the data set, and then writing documentation and code in the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language based on that research. 

### Introduction
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper *The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems* as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. Two of the three species were collected in the Gaspé Peninsula all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus.(ref [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set))

The iris dataset contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species.The three classes in the Iris dataset:
 * Iris-setosa 
 * Iris-versicolor 
 * Iris-virginica 

The four features of the Iris dataset:
 * sepal length in cm
 * sepal width in cm
 * petal length in cm
 * petal width in cm

Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.(ref [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set))

### Importance of Fisher's Iris Data Set
Fisher's linear discriminant analysis used methods in statistics and pattern recognition to find a linear combination of features which characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events. The resulting combination may be used as a linear classifier ([ref](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1ab8/ea71fbef3b55b69e142897fadf43b3269463.pdf))

This lead to the development of machine learning.

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset from the 1930s; it is one of the first modern examples of statistical classification.
The setting is that of Iris flowers, of which there are multiple species that can be identified by their morphology. Today, the species would be defined by their genomic signatures, but in the 1930s, DNA had not even been identified as the carrier of genetic information.

 Relevant Information:
   --- This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern
       recognition literature.  Fisher's paper is a classic in the field
       and is referenced frequently to this day.  (See Duda & Hart, for
       example.)  The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each,
       where each class refers to a type of iris plant.  One class is
       linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly
       separable from each other.
   --- Predicted attribute: class of iris plant.
   --- This is an exceedingly simple domain.
   --- This data differs from the data presented in Fishers article
	(identified by Steve Chadwick,  spchadwick@espeedaz.net )
	The 35th sample should be: 4.9,3.1,1.5,0.2,"Iris-setosa"
	where the error is in the fourth feature.
	The 38th sample: 4.9,3.6,1.4,0.1,"Iris-setosa"
	where the errors are in the second and third features.
